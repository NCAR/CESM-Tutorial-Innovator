# - The section **_Documentation_** explains how to find information about the namelist variables on the CESM webpage.
# - The section **_Customizing output_** describes how to customize the output history files, such as changing the output frequency or adding variables to a file.
# - The section **_Exercises_** offers opportunities to practice the concepts learned in this chapter.
