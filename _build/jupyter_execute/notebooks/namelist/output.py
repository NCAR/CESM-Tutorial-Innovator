# # Customizing Output
# 

# If you don't add anything to the namelist, CESM will generate its **``default output``**. This is what was done in previous chapters of this tutorial. Typically, the model outputs monthly means (and in some cases, higher frequency outputs) of a default set of variables. Depending on your needs, you may want to output variables at a different frequency, or add more variables, etc ...  
# 
# In this chapter **``Customizing output``**, we will cover how to output at a different frequency, add history files, or add variables to the history files.
# 
# In the sections below, we provide the basics of customizing the output for the different components (atm, lnd, ice, and pop). The **``Customize CAM output``** is the most **_comprehensive_**, so we recommend **_at least reviewing that section_**.
