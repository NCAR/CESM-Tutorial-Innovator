# # Analyze CESM2-LE
# 
# This contains the notebooks from Isla to look at the CESM2 LE. 
# - **Plot precipitation**: In this notebook you'll read in data from 50 members of the CESM2 large ensemble and explore the climate change response and the uncertainty due to internal variability in the winter means of precipitation
# - **Plot temperature**: In this notebook you'll read in data from 50 members of the CESM2 large ensemble and explore the climate change response and the uncertainty due to natural internal variability in the annual mean near surface air temperature (variable TREFHT)
